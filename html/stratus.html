								<p>Our project this summer was to create a new way to visualize complex data in an immediately understandable way. We’ve created a market-ready application that allows users to instantaneously interpret real-time data feeds through an augmented reality interface.  

										<br><br>[image]<br><br>  
								To create our app, we chose a specific domain of data to work with: weather. It's an excellent example of the big data problem, not only because of the sheer volume of information constantly being generated, but also the incomprehensible format in which it is encoded. Specifically, we focused on creating a working application that would help pilots receive and interpret weather data. 
								
								<br><br>[image]<br> <br>
								
								This is a METAR. METARs are the reports that pilots use to get weather information about airports. Every airport in the world generates METARs, and they’re usually pushed out every fifteen minutes. They’re encoded in a specific format that very few people can read. 
								
								<br><br>[image]<br> <br>
								
								Here’s the same METAR in plain English. As you can see, while the information is more readable, it’s very surface level and still requires a lot of knowledge and experience to fully understand. Even if someone is trained to decipher METAR reports, there is no guarantee that the way that they interpret the data is consistent with how other people may interpret it.  
								
								<br><br>[image]<br><br>  
								
								By instead visualizing this data, we’ve created a standard by which the information is presented. It allows the user to instantaneously comprehend the information that is generated without needing to decode it first. Now, allow us to introduce Stratus - the future of live data visualization. 
								
									
								
								<br><br>[image]<br><br>  
								
								<br><br>[video]<br><br>  
								
								<br><br>[image]<br> <br> 
								
								While the video explained the basic functionality of our app, we’d like to take some time to explain our design methodology. 
								
								<br><br>[image]<br><br> 
								
								In Stratus, there are three main environments that display different types of data, each using a unique visualization method. For example, cloud types and heights have a very clear visual representation, but more abstract data like wind movement and pressure are much harder to visualize. Just because data might represent something abstract doesn’t mean it can’t still be presented in an intuitive way.  
								
								<br><br>[image]<br>  <br>
								
								We’ve also used multiple techniques to present the same set of information to provide clarity and ensure that the data is interpreted correctly. For example, in the pressure environment, both the color and speed of the arrows correspond to the magnitude of the pressure and help users immediately visualize an otherwise completely abstract concept. Having both these methods of visualizing pressure is important and illustrates the fact that data may need to be represented in more than one way to be quickly understood. 
								
								<br><br>[image]<br><br> 
								
								We chose to display a realistic interpretation of the weather using satellite imagery and visually accurate clouds, rain, and other elements. We specifically used variables provided by the METAR report to generate several different types of clouds that are accurate to the actual clouds present at the location. This realism creates an experience like looking out the window, which helps build an understanding about the current weather conditions that a traditional forecast cannot. Creating a realistic scene emphasizes the reliability of the data, as it provides a frame of reference that the user can pull from their own experience with the real world.  
								
								<br><br>[image]<br><br> 
								
								Sometimes, it can still be important to provide an alternative to a visualization when the precise measurements matter, like when calibrating flight instruments. To do this, we’ve made all the pieces of the METAR report available as numbers to provide additional information and specificity where a visual representation cannot. This combination of 2D and 3D data visualization provides a complete package for both understanding data at a glance and being able to use it more effectively while in the field.  
								
								<br<br>>[image]<br><br> 
								
								We’ve also given the user control over the display of the data in other ways, from the ability to change the units of the measurements to changing the visualization’s time. These controls also contribute to the overall effectiveness of the app.  
								
								<br><br>[image]<br><br> 
								
								Our solution has implications beyond weather data. This concept of visualizing data in AR can also be used as a foundation to build upon for solving other big data problems. 
									
								
								<br><br>[image]<br> <br> 
								
								Realistic and seamless integration with the real world is one the key benefits of using augmented reality to display complicated, unintuitive, and otherwise abstract data. While a data source might be too large or complex to obtain any useful knowledge from, augmented reality presents this data in a format that we are well equipped to understand. We are very familiar with seeing physical objects in the real world, so seeing something in AR builds on that preexisting understanding.  
								
								<br><br>[image]<br><br>  
								
								It also makes the consumption of data much more enjoyable by introducing an element of exploration. There’s something really exciting about seeing and exploring something new that reading numbers can’t match. While enjoyment isn’t necessary to analyze data, those that do so will find making the process as painless as possible much more appealing.  
								
								<br><br>[image]<br><br> 
								
								That’s especially important considering that there are over 2.5 billion gigabytes of data being generated every day. In some cases, processing this information quickly and correctly can be a matter of life and death. For example, when communities face natural disasters like wildfires, tornadoes, or hurricanes, it can be easy for residents to ignore the threat and assume there isn’t any serious danger. But by visualizing real-time information about the disaster with augmented reality, the gravity of the situation becomes much more immediate and concerning. 
								
								<br><br>[image]<br><br>  
								
								Another application is with cyber security. As cyber terrorism and crime continue to rise, so does the need for counter measures. Because so much of the data generated from these attacks is difficult to understand, using augmented reality solutions would allow for security experts to visualize the location, type, and level of these threats in a much faster way.  
								
								<br><br>[image]<br><br>  
								
								The applications for this technology really are endless. It could be used to develop understanding of weather patterns in space, map resource consumption, visualize real-time biometric readings, and track climate change data. This project is about much more than just weather, it’s changing the fundamental way we interact with data. 
								
								<br><br>[image]<br><br>  
								
								Our project is an exciting example of how the definition of data visualization is being rewritten for the future, to better serve human understanding of data though new technologies. Bringing together AR and data visualization is a fantastic opportunity to explore how people absorb and interpret information, and we believe that the work we have done is a big step into investigating this relationship.
